Pionia Framework is a PHP framework for building RESTFUL APIs. 
It is a lightweight framework that is easy to use and easy to understand.

It runs on top of âœ¨ Moonlight âœ¨ architecture.

> 1. ðŸ“‚ authentication:-
       This is where authentication backends should reside. These are the strategies that the app will use to authenticate users to the app context. 
> 2. ðŸ“‚ middlewares:- This is where all request middlewares reside. These are the classes that run on every request and every response.
> 3. ðŸ“‚ services:- This is where our actual business logic resides.
> 4. ðŸ“‚ commands:- This is where all our commandline commands reside.
> 5. ðŸ“‚ environment:- This is where all our environment settings reside.
> 6. ðŸ“‚ storage:- This is where all our storage files reside.
> 7. ðŸ“‚ static:- This is where all our static files reside. Default files found here should never be deleted.
> 8. ðŸ“‚ vendor:- This is where all our composer dependencies reside.
> 9. ðŸ“„ .gitignore:- This is where we specify files that should not be tracked by git.
> 10. ðŸ“„ composer.json:- This is where we specify all our composer dependencies.
> 11. ðŸ“„ composer.lock:- This is where we specify all our composer dependencies.
> 12. ðŸ“„ pionia:- This is our commandline helper. For every command, we call this file. 
> 13. ðŸ“‚ public:- This is where our public files reside. This is where our entry file resides. 
> 14. ðŸ“„ switches:- This is where our main app switch resides. This is where we register all our services. 
> 15. ðŸ“„ pionia:- This is our commandline helper. For every command, we call this file.
> 16. ðŸ“„ README.md:- This is our documentation file. This is where we document our project.
> 17. ðŸ“‚ bootstrap:- This is where our application bootstrapping files reside. This is where we register all our routes.

After installation, just run the following to start the server
```bash
php pionia serve  # http://localhost:8000
```

By default, the server will run on port 8000, to change that, run the following
```bash
 php pionia serve --port 8080 # http://localhost:8080
```

Your endpoint is now running on http://localhost:8080/api/v1/

## Official Documentation

You can follow along the documentation but its under active development.

[Go to documentation here](https://pionia.netlify.app/)

You can also run ``` php pionia``` to get a list of all available commands.

If you're making any http requests from your frontend, we recommend using the `jet-fetch` library.
However, other framework-specific packages are still okay like the `z-fetch` for `z-js` and `axios`.

In the root of your project, run :-

NPM
```bash
npm install jet-fetch
```

YARN
```bash 
yarn add jet-fetch
```

Then use the `moonlightRequest` method of the package to query any moonlight-powered backend.

```js
import { Jet } from 'jet-fetch';
const jet = new Jet({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api/',
});

// unauthenticated requests
const res = await jet.moonlightRequest(
    { 
           service: 'yourService', 
           action: 'yourAction', 
           ...anyOtherData 
    }, 'v2/');

// for jwt-authenticated requests
const res = await jet.secureMoonlightRequest(
        {
               service: 'yourService',
               action: 'yourAction',
               ...anyOtherData
        }, 'v2/');
```
