The first PHP REST framework that is truly restful.

It runs on top of âœ¨ Moonlight âœ¨ architecture.

> 1. ðŸ“‚ authentication:-
       This is where authentication backends should reside. These are the strategies that the app will use to authenticate users to the app context. 
> 2. ðŸ“‚ middlewares:- This is where all request middlewares reside. These are the classes that run on every request and every response.
> 3. ðŸ“‚ services:- This is where our actual business logic resides.
> 5. ðŸ“„ switches:- This is where our main app switch resides. This is where we register all our services.
> 6. ðŸ“„ routes.php:- This is where we register our service switches
> 7. ðŸ“„ index.php:- This is our entry file to our project.
> 8. ðŸ“„ pionia:- This is our commandline helper. For every command, we call this file.
> 9. ðŸ“„ settings.ini:- All settings for our entire project reside here.

After installation, just run the following to start the server
```bash
php pionia serve  # http://localhost:8000
```

By default, the server will run on port 8000, to change that, run the following
```bash
php pionia serve -p8080 # http://localhost:8080
```

Your endpoint is now running on http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
